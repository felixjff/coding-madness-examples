# coding-madness-examples

This repo contains 3 examples:

## VueJS

Use this example if you're a VueJS fan. Or just want to learn VueJS.

## React

Use this example if you're a React fan. Or just want to learn React.

## jQuery

Use this example in all the other cases. This example contains a slightly less stable implementation of the GraphQL client. But this example does not use any library besides a little jQuery. *So you can use this for inspiration if you want to implement a GraphQL client in your own programming language.*
